The COVID-19 Symptom Survey Dashboard is an Excel-based data visualization project that analyzes survey responses from 100 participants regarding COVID-19 symptoms, test results, and vaccination status. The dashboard provides clear insights through charts, graphs, and summary statistics, making it easier to understand symptom trends, vaccination coverage, and testing outcomes. This project demonstrates how Excel can be used as a powerful tool for data analysis and visualization, helping to transform raw survey data into meaningful, decision-oriented insights.
